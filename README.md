# Questionnaire-Model
The questionnaire generator model is a pre-trained T5 model fine-tuned with the SQUAD V2 dataset for question answer generation.
The dataset has questions and answers created from multiple passages. The T5 model is fine-tuned with this remarkale dataset for the task of question generations.
This project is developed for the field of EdTech by easing the process of creating questionnaires for students/test attendees. One can automate the process of generating the questions just by feeding the passage from which the questions should be generated from.
